realtime communication services for HTML5 games

## TODO

* try auto-reconnect when back online -> monitor connection by an interval timer?
* be a little bit more verbose why a CometSocket connection is closed 1006, try to reconnect
* remname chat server to general channel / broadcast server
* add server timestamp to events
* chat example application: use MD5 hash for channel key and aes for  message content
* CometSocket think about an optional guaranteed in-order message delivery
